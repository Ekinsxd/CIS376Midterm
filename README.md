Assignment description:

Games today are too easy to beat. You can gripe all you want about Dark Souls, but I'm pretty sure the first MegaMan, SuperMario, and Castlevania games caused more anger and stress than any game that's come out since. I'm dissociating just thinking about it...

For our first large project, you will use your engine to recreate a level from a game from the 8-bit era. There are plenty to choose from, as this encompasses everything from the Atari 2600, NES, and Sega 1000 systems (along with many others). We won't be trying to recreate an entire game, simply a level or part of a level. Here are some possibilities:

- a Donkey Kong level
- part of a SuperMario, Castlevania, or Metroid level
- a Defender clone
- a single Smash level

I'm not expecting a full, polished game, but I am expecting something that works well. You should adhere to the following criteria:

- you used Box2D for physics. This means games that are not physics based (i.e. PacMan) are out. If you have questions, clear the game with me first.
- you use free assets, or assets that you own the rights to. You may purchase them if you wish, create your own, find public domain ones, etc.
- you use the game engine you wrote.
- you have win/loss conditions that trigger automatically when a win/loss event occurs.
- you have sound effects/music
- there are enemies and/or other obstacles. I should not be able to merely walk through the level. It should be challenging.
- no AI is needed. Enemies (if any) can merely move in predetermined ways (i.e. a Goomba walking left and right continuously).
- you communicate the "plot" in some way. The plot need not be complex, but players should know what the goal is.

Don't get over-ambitious; scope creep can be a problem. I'm not looking for professional quality; writing games is **hard** . I'm looking for beta-level demos. The main learning objective for this assignment is to get comfortable using a physics engine in your own projects, and to apply the lessons on game development you have acquired thus far.

Groups can be up to 3 people. You cannot wait to start on this; it is a significant endeavor and needs to be started immediately.
